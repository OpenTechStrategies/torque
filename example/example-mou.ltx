\opening{\textbf{Memorandum of Understanding}}
\end{center}

This letter outlines our mutual understanding of various endeavors to
be collaboratively undertaken as per our previous discussions.  While
it could have been generated by GPT-3 or any other pre-trained
generative neural network, we typed it out by hand because we care.

Please have your people call our people to work out a schedule of
deliverables, invoicing, and payment.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
