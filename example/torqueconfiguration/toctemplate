{#
  This template not only links to the appropriate page, but also includes
  the organization name and rank.

  The full jinja templating system is available to us, so we could do something
  like displaying a different line for those users with access to confidential
  columns if we wanted.  We could also use html styling to have an "expand" block,
  or do it via table rows.
