<!--

  We configured above that the main config page should live at TorqueConfig:MainConfig
  when setting up our LocalSettings file.

  When saving this page, all the links should be red for pages that are not yet
  created, and there should be a header at the top that alerts you to the fact
  that they don't exist.

  In this configuration, we have two groups of users: sysops (which is a MediaWiki
  defined group) and public users.  The latter needed to be configured in
  LocalSettings.  We also have three templates, one view templates, as well as
  a Search template and a TOC template.

  We can click on all these pages and create each one in turn.
